        <h3>Valorant is better than Call of Duty because the art style is leagues above what Call of Duty has. On the technical end (server end), it has the best servers for the best connection between players. Everyone is engaged in the game because everyone on the team has a purpose. While Call of Duty has the same generic soldier characters running around in an attempt at a realistic vision, that ends up being unrealistic. At least Valorant takes the unrealistic vision and hits home with it's environments.</h3>
